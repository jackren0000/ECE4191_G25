### **ECE4191_G25: Robotics & Autonomous Systems! ü§ñ**

Welcome to my **ECE4191_G25** project repository! This is where I explored the exciting world of robotics and autonomous systems. This project involved developing and integrating various modules for robot control, navigation, and object detection.

#### **What You'll Find Here üöÄ**

This repository contains the core components of our robotics project:

*   **`main.py`:** The main script that orchestrates the robot's operations.
*   **`MotorControl.py`:** Python module for controlling the robot's motors.
*   **`motorpassencoder.py`:** Likely handles motor encoder feedback for precise movement.
*   **`QRdetectionAndNavigation.py`:** Module for detecting QR codes and using them for navigation.
*   **`robot.py`:** Core robot functionalities and interfaces.
*   **`yolo_detectObstacles`:** (Likely a directory or script related to) Object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for obstacle avoidance.
*   **`yolo_QRdetectionAndNavigation.py`:** Integrates YOLO with QR detection for more robust navigation.
*   **`instruction/`:** Contains instructions or documentation for the project.
*   **`readyForImprovements/`:** Perhaps a directory for future enhancements or experimental code.
*   **`test/`:** Test scripts for various modules.
*   **`usefulcmds`:** A collection of useful commands or snippets.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** Lists all the necessary Python libraries.

#### **My Robotics Journey ‚ú®**

This project allowed me to dive deep into:

*   **Robot Kinematics & Control:** Implementing precise motor control and navigation algorithms.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Utilizing sensors (like cameras for QR detection) to enable autonomous behavior.
*   **Computer Vision for Robotics:** Applying advanced computer vision techniques (like YOLO) for object detection and environmental understanding.
*   **System Integration:** Bringing together various software components to create a functional robotic system.

#### **Tech I'm Using üõ†Ô∏è**

*   Python
*   OpenCV (for image processing and QR detection)
*   TensorFlow / PyTorch (for YOLO, depending on implementation)
*   Robotics frameworks/libraries (implied by the project type)
